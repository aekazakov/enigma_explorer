# Overview

[ENIGMA Explorer](http://isolates.genomics.lbl.gov) currently serves as the open-access, graphical interface to the ENIGMA data collection, i.e. the isolates data and the growth curve plates data of ENIGMA. The ENIGMA explorer is not part of KBase, which the former one does not intend to include genomic sequences nor APPs for the analyses of such.

ENIGMA Explorer is a portal to look up for **isolates** or **growth curve plates** data, as well as providing basic interpretatons of such data. Researchers are encouraged to realize more complicated analysis via the ENIGMA Explorer APIs (see the [API docs](https://github.com/RandolphLiu/enigma_explorer/blob/master/docs/api.md)).
